=== Four in A Row ===
I created this program as way for me to study some simple Heuristic AI. The game is a basic clone of Connect 4 with the aim of the game to create a connection of 4 tokens in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

It has multiple AI difficulty levels, starting from ones that make obvious mistakes, to the highest level in which it tries to force the other player into a position where it must lose. Because my aim was to have the AI play using heuristics somewhat like a human player, it doesn't do any type of brute forced search of the future possible moves. Well except for some particular win/lose plays as I imagine any good human player would.

I only created the most basic GUI which would let me work on the AI, so it doesn't look particularly good.

--- Project status & Licence ----
I consider this mini project complete as it's done what I set out for it to do. I haven't set any particular licence on the code, so the copyright remains mine. But I'm not all that fussy, so if you'd like to use it just drop me an email and we can sort something out.
